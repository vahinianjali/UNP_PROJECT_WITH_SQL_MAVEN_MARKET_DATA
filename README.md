# UNP_PROJECT_WITH_SQL_MAVEN_MARKET_DATA

As part of an internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP Education), a SQL-based data analytics project was undertaken using the Maven Market retail dataset. The project involved designing and managing a relational database with well-structured tables for Customers, Products, Stores, Regions, Returns, and Transactions. Data was imported from backup tables, cleaned, and normalized, with appropriate primary and foreign key relationships established to maintain integrity. A series of optimized SQL queries were developed to analyze key metrics such as average product cost, store-wise sales, customer distribution by marital status, total revenue, average product weight, revenue by region and income group, top returned products, transaction counts, and revenue by membership type. These insights enabled a comprehensive understanding of sales performance, customer behavior, and regional trends to support strategic decision-making. The project provided practical experience in MySQL, relational database management, and retail business analytics, with all work compiled and submitted for reference and future use.
